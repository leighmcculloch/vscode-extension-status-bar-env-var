# VSCode Extension: Status Bar Env Var

Display system environment variables that VSCode is running in the context of in the status bar.

This extension only runs locally and not in remote environments. This means that when using a remote environment the environment variables displayed are those of the local machine running the VSCode UI and not those of the remote VSCode Server.

## Usage

In the settings specify a comma-separated list of environment variables that should be displayed in the status bar. The status bar will update immediately to show the variable name and value.
